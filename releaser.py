"""Release SixthSenseReborn: set the version, file the changelog, build, commit, tag and upload.

Double-click this file, or run py releaser.py, and it offers a numbered menu: the whole release, or any one
step of it.  Every step says what it is about to do and asks Y or N first, and it waits for Enter at the
end so you can hear how it went.  compiler.py does the building; this does everything around it,
the zip included.

The steps, in the order a full release takes them:

    1. check      everything is committed and pushed, the GitHub CLI is here and signed in, and the
                  changelog has changes waiting under "unrelease:" - at least 5 of them, and no more
                  than 100.  With 1 to 4 it asks whether to release anyway
    2. prepare    VERSION becomes today's date and that day's release number, 26.09.23-1 for the first
                  release on the 23rd of September 2026, -2 for the second, counted from the tags; and the
                  lines under "unrelease:" are filed under that version in docks\\changelog.txt
    3. build      compiler.py builds it into dist\\SixthSenseReborn-Windows, or dist/SixthSenseReborn-Linux on Linux: the
                  folder build, or the single executable with the sounds and the game's data inside.  If
                  the build fails, VERSION and the changelog go back to how they were
    4. zip        the build becomes dist\\SixthSenseReborn-Win-<version>.zip, or SixthSenseReborn-Linux-<version>.zip,
                  which extracts to a folder of the same name as the build's - only a build made for this
                  version, so an older build can never go out under the new name
    5. commit     VERSION and docks\\changelog.txt are committed as "Release <version>" and pushed
    6. tag        the commit is tagged V<version>, and the tag is pushed
    7. upload     the zip goes up to GitHub as the release "SixthSenseReborn V<version>", with that version's
                  changelog lines as its notes; if that release is already there, the zip is added to it

A step you answer N to is skipped, and the ones after it still ask; each checks for itself that what it
needs is there.  Nothing here ever moves or deletes a tag or a release that already exists, or replaces a
file already on one.

One release carries the Windows and the Linux build (tunmi13productions, 2026-09-28;
aidocks/project_linux_release_plan.md).  PyInstaller builds only for the system it runs on, so the full
release runs on one, and then "Add this system's build to the release" on the other builds, zips and adds
its zip to the same release.  On Linux, WSL included, the GitHub CLI has to be installed and signed in
there too.
