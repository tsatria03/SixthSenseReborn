"""Build SixthSenseReborn into an executable with PyInstaller.

It builds into dist/SixthSenseReborn-Windows, dist/SixthSenseReborn-Linux or dist/SixthSenseReborn-macOS
for the current system, and nothing else: it never zips and never changes the
repository.  Setting the version, filing the changelog, zipping, tagging and uploading a release are
releaser.py's work, and the releaser calls this to do the building.

Double-click this file, or run py compiler.py with nothing after it, and it offers a numbered menu of
builds, then waits for Enter at the end so you can hear how it went.  Each choice is one of these flags,
which still work typed out:

    py compiler.py                the folder build: the game's data beside the executable
    py compiler.py --embed        one executable with the sounds and the game's data inside it
    py compiler.py --clean        empty PyInstaller's cache first
    py compiler.py --console      keep a console window, to see why the game will not start
    py compiler.py --onefile      one executable with the game's data still beside it
    py compiler.py --no-game      leave the game's data out
    py compiler.py --dry-run      say what a build would do, build nothing

Every build lands in dist\\SixthSenseReborn-Windows, around SixthSenseReborn.exe, with the text a player reads beside the executable - the readme,
the changelog and the todo list in a docks\\ folder, as in the repository, and VERSION and the license at
the top.  Those are never put inside it.  The third-party licenses go inside the executable, as
licenses\\, whichever kind of build (since 2026-09-25).  That folder is what releaser.py zips into
dist\\SixthSenseReborn-Win-<VERSION>.zip.

The port and the vendored DLLs always go inside the build.  In the folder build the game's own files do
not: the plists and the three map layers are copied next to the executable, into game\\, and the sounds
into game\\sounds\\used with their folders, which is where sixthsense/paths.py looks for them when
frozen.  game\\sounds\\unused, what the game never plays, stays in the repository and is never built
(tsatria03, 2026-10-06: "it should only build with sounds/used").  With --embed the same files go inside the executable instead,
and paths.py finds them in the folder it unpacks itself to; that costs a few seconds at every launch.
Nothing else in the original app bundle is copied: the game never opens any of it.

There is no --test yet.  A test build would start the game and read its log; SixthSenseReborn does not write a
log, or a crash.txt, so there is nothing for a test run to read.  A windowed build that fails says
why aloud, in one line; build with --console to see the whole traceback.

macOS builds are self-contained .app bundles for the build Python's architecture; --console keeps
the console-folder format for debugging.

#:                what was bundled.
