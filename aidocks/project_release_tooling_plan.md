description: "FINISHED 2026-09-23, confirmed by the dev, and used for every release since. compiler.py only builds, as a folder or with --embed as one exe holding the sounds and data; releaser.py sets the date version, files the changelog, runs the compiler, zips, commits, tags V<version> and uploads the zip to GitHub. Every decision the dev made, the plan change that moved the zip, and what was built."

**Status: FINISHED, 2026-09-23.** The dev tested both and confirmed: "I tested the compiler and the releaser, and they both worked." They made a real release with the releaser, then deleted it. Checked afterwards: no GitHub release and no tag remain, locally or on GitHub, and `dist\` is empty. `main` is still at `3a2ab0c` with `VERSION` at `26.09.21-1`, so no "Release" commit stayed either. The dev has made the real releases with it since the same day. Once, an attempt stopped after the prepare step and left `VERSION` and `changelog.txt` changed, which the check then refused; they were restored with `git restore` at the dev's word and the full release run again. A possible improvement, offered but not asked for: let the check pass when those two files already hold today's version, so a stopped release can simply be run again. Individual releases are not recorded here ([[feedback_no_release_records]]).

Planned and built the same day, at the dev's go-ahead ("then we can get to work on the actual game releaser"), in commit `3a2ab0c`. `tests/case/release.py` passes 23 of 23.

**Plan change, 2026-09-23, after the first build:** the zip moves out of the compiler too. The dev: "The compiler should only handle making the folder, and or embedding the assets and stuff if you allow it", and the releaser should ask whether to make the zip. So `package()` and `--no-package` leave `compiler.py`; the compiler builds `dist\SeventhSense` (a folder build, or `--embed`) and stops. The releaser gains its own Package step, asked Y or N, between Build and Commit, and it refuses to zip a build whose `VERSION` is not the one being released. Its menu gains "Zip the build". The notes below are updated to match.

**What was built, against the plan below:**
- `compiler.py`: the filing (`plan_changelog`, `prepare_release_files`, `first_version`) is gone from it. `unreleased_lines` is new. `--embed` stages the top-folder files in `build\embed\game` (`EMBED_STAGE`, `stage_embedded`), and adds that folder and `sounds\used` whole through `embedded_data()`. Every build lands in `dist\SeventhSense` (`output_dir`, and `--distpath` for one-file builds), which `clear_output` empties first. The shipped changelog is stripped of an empty `unrelease:` on every build. `todo list.txt` is in `SIDE_FILES`. `package()`, `PACK_STEPS`, `--no-package` and `import zipfile` are gone. The menu: 1 Folder build, 2 Single exe, then clean, console, one-file, no game data, and dry run.
- `releaser.py`: the menu is 1 Full release, then Check, Set the version and file the changelog, Build, Zip the build, Commit and push, Tag, and Upload. `package(build_dir, version)` moved here from the compiler. `step_package` refuses when the `VERSION` beside the built exe (`built_version()`) is not the release's, and a N answer skips it. It imports `compiler` and calls `compiler.main(flags)` in-process, since a subprocess with a keyboard attached would open the compiler's menu. It looks for `gh` on the PATH, then in `~/.game_tools/tools.ini`, then at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`. Tags are read locally and from `origin`. It refuses more than `MAX_ENTRIES` (100) unreleased lines. The commit message is "Release <version>". Upload runs `gh release create <tag> <zip> --title ... --notes-file ... --verify-tag`.
- Not yet run by anyone: the embed build's start-up (`paths.py` should find `ROOT/game` in `_MEIPASS`), and the real `gh` calls. When it is built, change this status to "built, not yet confirmed". Change it to "finished" only once the dev says it works ([[feedback_record_plans_first]]), then fold the lasting parts into [[project_compiler_py]].

The dev asked for "a releaser python script", pointing at two references in the gitignored `user/` folder: a release script from another of their projects (a numbered menu of git and release steps, driving `gh`) and another port's build script (a PyInstaller one-file build with the game data added inside). Read both there, but never name them in writing ([[feedback_no_other_games]]).

## The split (the dev's words: the compiler "should only deal with compiling the game and packaging it into a zip, also an option to embedded most things into the exe file", and the releaser "will handle everything else, like creating tags, finding packages, and then uploading them")

### compiler.py: build, nothing else (the zip moved to the releaser; see the plan change above)
- Never touches `changelog.txt` or `VERSION` any more. `prepare_release_files`, `plan_changelog` and the rest of the filing move to the releaser. The menu's "Release build" becomes a plain "Build and zip" (and, after the plan change above, "Folder build", with no zip).
- Keeps taking the empty `unrelease:` heading out of the copy beside the exe (`strip_shipped_changelog`), and keeps warning when that copy still has unreleased lines (`release_warnings`).
- **New: an embed option**, a single exe with the game's data inside, through PyInstaller `--onefile` and `--add-data`. Whole folders are passed, not one entry per file, or the command line gets too long. `paths.py` needs no change: frozen, `ROOT` is `sys._MEIPASS`, and `_candidates()` already tries `ROOT/game`.
  - **Inside:** `game/sounds/used` (329 files, about 125.6 MB, with its folders), the 142 `.plist` files and the three map layers `g_CH1_E`, `a_CH1_E.txt`, `s_CH1_E.txt` (about 0.3 MB). This is exactly what `copy_game()` copies today.
  - **Never packed, in any build:** the PNG and JPG images, the nibs, `en.lproj`, the iOS executable `game/sixsense`, `iTunesArtwork`, `PkgInfo`, `_CodeSignature`, `FacebookSDKResources.bundle`, `stage1ground`, `stage1sound` and `game/sounds/unused`. The game never opens them. The dev first said "the game's binary", meaning the `game` folder, and agreed once the list was explained.
  - The cost, told to the dev: a one-file exe unpacks its roughly 126 MB to a temp folder on every launch, so it starts a few seconds slower.
- **Beside the exe, never embedded ("Docks never get embedded"):** `changelog.txt`, **`todo list.txt` (new, the dev asked for it to ship)**, `license.txt`, `VERSION` and the `licenses` folder. `todo list.txt` goes into `SIDE_FILES` under its own name. This is why the todo list became players only ([[feedback_todo_list_format]], [[project_dev_tasks]]).
- Folder builds stay as they are, with the data beside the exe in `game\`.

### releaser.py: new, beside compiler.py
A numbered menu like the compiler's: "Full release", plus each step on its own. Each step asks Y or N. **Only the release steps**: no commit, undo, push, history or hand-made tag options ("I do not plan to make hand written commits or tags myself"). **No website step**, because Sixth Sense has no website.
1. **Check** that the tree is clean and pushed, `gh` is there (`C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`; the dev's shared `%USERPROFILE%\.game_tools\tools.ini` has a `gh` entry), and `unrelease:` has lines.
2. **Version, automatic** (the dev: "I'd rather it be automatic"): today's date as `YY.MM.DD-N`, the format kept, written to `VERSION`. N is that day's release number, counted from the existing `V<date>-*` tags: `-1` for the first release of the day, `-2` for the second. The repo has no tags yet, and `VERSION` still says `26.09.21-1` from the first commit.
3. **Changelog:** file the `unrelease:` lines under the new version, the moved `plan_changelog` logic. It keeps the old `VERSION` and changelog, and puts both back if the build fails, so a failed build still leaves the repository unchanged.
4. **Build:** run the compiler, and ask for a folder build or the single exe.
5. **Commit and push** `changelog.txt` and `VERSION`.
6. **Tag:** `V` plus the version, for example `V26.09.23-1` (the dev: "That's how tags work on github"). Push the tag. Refuse to overwrite a tag or release that already exists.
7. **Upload:** find the zip in `dist\`, then `gh release create` with the title **`SeventhSense V<version>`** (for example "SeventhSense V26.09.21-3"), and that version's changelog lines as the notes.
- **Archive: a zip only**, as now. The dev turned down a password-protected 7z.

### Also in the same change
- New `tests/case/release.py`, covering only what can be checked without building or uploading: the version numbering against a list of tags, filing the changelog, and finding the zip. Run only that file ([[feedback_dont_run_or_build]]).
- README.md, CLAUDE.md and [[project_compiler_py]] describe how to build and release.
- The dev runs the releaser and the compiler. Claude never runs either, and never builds or uploads.

## Related rules made the same day
- A release aims for 50 to 100 changelog entries, can go out with fewer, and never holds more than 100 ([[feedback_changelog]]).
- Debug mode is developer-facing and never goes in the changelog or the todo list ([[project_dev_tasks]]).

**Changed 2026-09-28:** one release carries the Windows build as a zip and the Linux build as a .tar.gz, each packed on its own system; the second adds its archive to the release ([[project_linux_release_plan]]).
