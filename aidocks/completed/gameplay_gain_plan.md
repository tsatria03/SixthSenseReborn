description: "FINISHED 2026-09-26, confirmed by tunmi13productions, who asked for it. A gameplay gain of 0 to 6 dB (listener gain up to 2.0) that raises every sound during play without changing the balance, plus weapons, entities and player volumes (0 to 100) to change the balance. Page Up and Page Down with modifiers during play, saved in settings.json, spoken in both modes."

**Status: FINISHED, 2026-09-26, confirmed by tunmi13productions ("sounds right").** Asked for and agreed by tunmi13productions (the "dev" quoted below), recorded before any code ([[feedback_record_plans_first]]). Builds on [[project_volume_knobs]] and [[volume_settings_plan]].

**What was built:**
- `platform/volume.py`: `GAMEPLAY_GAIN_KEY`, `WEAPON_KEY`, `ENTITY_KEY`, `PLAYER_KEY` (the three groups joined `VOLUME_KEYS`), `gameplay_gain_db`, `valid_gain_db`, `step_gain_db`, `step_percent` (now shared with the menu music), `group_of`, `group_gain`, `gameplay_gain`. `load` reads and writes `GAMEPLAYGAIN` too.
- `game/oal_playback.py`: each buffer's `group`, each source's requested `gain`; `_gain` applies master, group, and for BACKDROP divides by `listenerGain`; `setListenerGain_`, `setGameplayGain_`, `refreshGains`. `platform/music.py`: `_heard` divides the players' gain by the listener gain.
- `platform/openal.py`: `alGetListenerf`, `listener_float`, and `ALC_OUTPUT_LIMITER_SOFT` asked for on open.
- `Stage_1_E.viewDidLoad` and `Stage_1_TEST.viewDidLoad` call `_gameplay_gain_on`; `Stage_1_E.teardown` turns it off (the tutorial inherits both).
- `AppDelegate.change_gameplay_volume(key, step)` steps, saves and applies. `ui/input.py`: `gameplay_volume_key`, in play and on the pause panel. `keymap.FIXED_IN_PLAY`, listed on the F1 screen's visual list.
- Note: `volume.gain(6)` is 1.995, just under the 2.0 cap.
- Tests: new `tests/case/gameplay_volume.py` (7); `tests/case/volume.py` 14 (two new, two updated for the new keys). The covering files all passed on 2026-09-26: volume, gameplay_volume, menu_music, input, monster_sound, music_memory, audio_device, save, paths, weapon_range, gameplay, tutorial, pause, menu, intro, store, window, data, weapon_stats.
- Docs: readme.txt ("Volume during a game", "Your save"), README.md, DIVERGENCES.md, changelog, todo list (unfinished).

**Superseded on 2026-09-27:** the recordings, the guns' included, are now levelled to one loudness by [[sound_trims_plan]], a fixed table no player sees, so the guns are even without a per-gun setting. **Declined the same day:** a per-gun trim to even out the guns' recordings (the shotgun's fire is about 3 dB louder than the AK's, measured; every gun fires at the 1.0 cap, so only the loud ones could come down): "adding per gun volume would make things complex". Also not done: letting entities go to 150%.

**The dev's request:** "is there possibly a way to increase game volume without affecting zombies overall? ... I could crank up, say, gameplay volume or something, so I can hear the zombies better. but without messing with zombie volumes and screwing them up. sort of like a gain knob". Then: "should we make individual volumes then? weapons volume, zombie volume, that sort?"

## Why a listener gain
- Every existing volume multiplies a source's own `AL_GAIN`, which OpenAL caps at 1.0, and gunshots already sit at 1.0, so those can only turn down.
- OpenAL's listener `AL_GAIN` comes after the mix and may go above 1.0. The game never sets it today, so it is 1.0.
- It raises every source by the same amount, so the zombies' near and far, the five lanes and one zombie against another all stay the binary's.
- Past full scale, OpenAL Soft's output limiter (on by default) squeezes the peaks rather than clipping.

## The gain
- **0 to 6 dB, whole numbers, 1 dB a step**, so at most a listener gain of 2.0. The dev chose 2.0 as the cap ("the safest gameplay cap would be, say, 2.0") and decibels for the file ("0 to 6 might be better"). 0, the default, is today's mix.
- **During play only**: the stage, the tutorial and the test range. The listener goes back to 1.0 on leaving them, so the menus are untouched.
- **What it raises:** every sound effect and the recorded speech. The dev: speech should "follow the gain", with no volume of its own.
- **What it leaves alone:** the level music and the ambience, which are OpenAL sources too. Their gain is divided by the listener gain so they sound as they do now (their gains, 0.02 to 0.5, stay under the 1.0 cap at 2x). They keep `LEVELMUSICVOLUME` and `AMBIENCEVOLUME`.

## The group volumes
0 to 100 percent, 10 a step by key, any whole number by hand, squared into the gain like the other volumes; 100, the default, is the binary's mix. Only down, because of the 1.0 cap; the gain is the way up (turning weapons down and the gain up makes the zombies louder than the guns).
- **Weapons:** `sfx/weapons/` (fire, reload, the empty click, the knives' draw and swing), but not the hits.
- **The hits count as entities** (the dev, 2026-09-26: "I don't think gun impacts/headshots should be affected by weapon volume. after all, the zombie is being hit"): `weapon_gun_att1` (a gun's hit), `weapon_gun_att2` (a gun's kill), and the knife's and the sword's `_att1` and `_att2`. The headshot callout, `headshot_4`, is speech and follows only the gain.
- **Entities:** `sfx/zombies/normal/`, `sfx/zombies/bosses/`, `sfx/monsters/` and `sfx/characters/` (the zombies' and the monster's steps, growls, attacks, being hurt and deaths, and the woman). The dev, 2026-09-26: "I say we group characters and zombies into a single thing, like entities".
- **Player:** `player_breath_1` to `3`, `player_damage` and `player_die` (in `sfx/misc/`).
- Everything else (`warring`, `ui_select`, the speech) has no group and follows only the master volume and the gain.
- A sound's group is decided from its file's folder or name when its buffer is loaded, and applied in `oal_playback` beside `volume.master`, so no caller has to remember it.
- A change applies at once to sounds already playing (the breathing, a zombie's loop), so each source keeps the gain the game asked for and has the knobs reapplied.

## The keys, during play only
Fixed, not rebindable, like the menu music's; the F1 screen lists them. On the menu screens Page Up and Page Down stay the menu music.
- **Page Up / Page Down:** the gain, 1 dB.
- **Shift + Page Up / Page Down:** weapons, 10%.
- **Control + Page Up / Page Down:** entities, 10%.
- **Alt + Page Up / Page Down:** player, 10%.
- Each press is saved to `settings.json` at once and spoken in both speech modes, since there is no recording for it: "Gain 3 decibels", "Entities 70 percent". At the end of the range it says the value again.

## settings.json
New keys after `AMBIENCEVOLUME` and before `EYEMODE`: `GAMEPLAYGAIN` (0 to 6, anything else counts as 0), `WEAPONVOLUME`, `ENTITYVOLUME`, `PLAYERVOLUME` (0 to 100, anything else counts as 100). Written with their defaults on the first start, like the others.

## Tests and docs
- `tests/case/volume.py`: defaults leave every gain exactly the binary's; each group moves only its own sounds; the gain sets the listener and leaves music and ambience as they were; bad values fall back; the keys step, hold at the ends and save.
- `docks/readme.txt` (the keys and the settings), `README.md`, `aidocks/DIVERGENCES.md` (the volume knobs entry), `project_volume_knobs.md`, the F1 screen's fixed keys, and a changelog line.

**Changed 2026-09-28:** the entities' volume (`ENTITYVOLUME`, Control) was removed; they are always at full volume ([[entity_full_volume_plan]]).
