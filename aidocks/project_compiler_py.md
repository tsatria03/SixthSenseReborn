`compiler.py` is the PyInstaller build script, with a numbered menu. Since 2026-09-23 it only builds; the changelog filing and the zip are `releaser.py`'s ([[release_tooling_plan]]). It was adapted from an earlier build script. A newer version of that script is kept for reference in the gitignored `user/` folder; read it there, but never edit it, and don't name it in writing ([[feedback_no_other_games]]). Never run `compiler.py`, not even `--dry-run`, without the dev's say-so; see [[feedback_dont_run_or_build]].

**Changed 2026-09-23, and confirmed working by the dev the same day:** the changelog filing and the zip moved out to the new `releaser.py`, so the compiler only builds `dist\SixthSense` and never changes the repository, and it gained `--embed`, one exe with the sounds and data inside. The menu's first two choices are now "Folder build" and "Single exe". The menu is now: 1 Folder build, 2 Single exe (`--embed`), 3 Clean, 4 Console, 5 One-file, 6 Without the game's data, 7 Dry run. The history below mentions `package()` and the old menu numbers as they were then. See [[release_tooling_plan]].

## Status

Adapted to Sixth Sense on 2026-09-21, with the dev's go-ahead.
- **First builds, 2026-09-22.** The dev ran menu choice 4 (`--console`) twice, at 08:28 and at 09:19.
  - Claude checked the 09:19 build's `dist/SixthSense` against the repo. It was complete:
    - all 474 game files, byte-identical to the repo
    - all 17 license files
    - the vendor DLLs in `_internal/vendor`
    - Prism with `prism.dll` and `_prism_cffi.pyd` in `_internal/prism/_native`, plus `_cffi_backend`
    - `changelog.txt`, `VERSION` and `license.txt`, identical to the repo's
  - PyInstaller's warning "missing module named prism._prism_cffi" is a false alarm. Prism's `_native.py` adds `prism/_native` to the package path when it is imported, which static analysis can't see.
  - `prism.lib` (15 KB, an import library) gets bundled too. It is harmless.
  - **The zip was broken**: 399 of 643 files, with no central directory. The dev had closed the window during packing, because nothing said to wait.
  - `package()` was changed the same day, checked only by parsing:
    - it says "packaging the release", then a line after each quarter of the files, then "the zip is done"
    - it writes `<name>.zip.part` and renames it only once it is whole
- **Confirmed working, 2026-09-22.** The dev rebuilt with choice 4 at 09:27 and said "The exe works".
  - Claude checked the zip: `zipfile.testzip` passes, and it holds 643 files (107 MB) under `SixthSense/`.
  - Every member is byte-identical to the built folder, and every game file to the repo. No `.part` file was left behind.
  - The todo item "Test the compiler with a first build" moved to finished that day.
- The dev built and released with the single exe on 2026-09-23 (26.09.23-1), which also tested a windowed build. Still untested: `--onefile` without `--embed`.
- Its comments and docstrings describe Sixth Sense alone; the three that named the project it came from were reworded on 2026-09-21 ([[feedback_no_other_games]]).

## What changed from the earlier script
- **Names:** `NAME='SixthSense'`, `ENTRY='SixthSenseReborn.py'`, the docstring, the argparse description, the menu title, and the closing credit (now "Bitbee's"; the original is `kr.co.bitbee.sixsense`).
- **`PLAY_PACKAGES`** is just `pygame` (pip name `pygame`, not `pygame-ce`, since the two conflict). numpy and av were dropped because Sixth Sense doesn't use them.
- **`OPTIONAL_PACKAGES`** held `comtypes` (the SAPI voice), with `optional_missing()` printing a "note:" line. **All of that was removed on 2026-09-22**, when Prism replaced comtypes (see below).
- **The HRTF check is gone:** `DATA` (`assets/hrtf`) and its check in `problems_now()` were removed, because HRTF is deliberately off in this port.
- **`--collect-all av` was removed.**
- **The new `GAME_FILES` and `game_files()`**, plus a rewritten `copy_game()`:
  - It copies only `*.wav`, `*.plist`, `g_CH1_E`, `a_CH1_E.txt` and `s_CH1_E.txt` from the bundle's top folder, matched without regard to case. With the original flat bundle that was 414 files, 106.6 MB. Since the sounds moved, it also copies `sounds/used/`; see below.
  - The iOS executable `sixsense`, the nibs, the PNGs and JPGs, `iTunesArtwork`, `PkgInfo` and the unused `stage1ground`/`stage1sound` stay out, as do the `_CodeSignature` and Facebook folders.
  - The source comes from `sixthsense.paths.game()`, which honors `--game` and `SIXTHSENSE_GAME`. If the bundle is missing it catches the SystemExit and prints a message instead of crashing.
- **`--test` was removed:** the flag, the menu entry, `test_build()` and `read_log()` are all gone. The menu then had 7 choices plus Quit, with Release build as number 1.
- **readme.html generation was removed** (`GENERATED_PAGES` and `write_page()`). The reference script in `user/` has it, along with the `tools/md_to_html.py` converter it needs; bring both back once there's a real README.
- **`FIRST_VERSION = '1.0.0-1'` became `first_version()`**, which returned `%y.%m.%d-1` to match the repo's date-scheme VERSION. It was removed on 2026-09-23; the releaser now sets VERSION ([[release_tooling_plan]]).
- **The docstrings and comments** no longer mention an updater, and they explain the missing `--test` and the silent windowed failure.

## Left out on purpose
The newer reference script in `user/` bakes VERSION into the build as a module. Sixth Sense has no updater, so that stays out unless the dev asks.

**Prism was added on 2026-09-22.** `compiler.py` now:
- requires `prismatoid`
- passes `--collect-all prism --hidden-import _cffi_backend` and Prism's native `.pyd`
- fills a `licenses` folder beside the executable: OpenAL Soft and the NVDA controller client from `vendor/`, and Prism and pygame from their installed packages

`OPTIONAL_PACKAGES`, `optional_missing()` and comtypes are gone. This has been checked only by parsing, and hasn't been built yet. See [[prism_speech]].

## Sounds moved (2026-09-21)
The sounds now live in `game/sounds/used/`, in folders ([[project_sound_organization]]). The same day, `compiler.py` was changed to ship them. This was checked by reading the code only, not run.
- `sound_files()` walks `sounds/used/` then `sounds/unused/` (`paths.SOUND_FOLDERS`) in sorted order, and `copy_game()` recreates each file's folder under `dist/SixthSense/game/`; `embedded_data()` adds both folders with `--embed`. `unused/` was left out until 2026-09-24, when the dev asked for it in builds, since the lookup now searches it last. `data_summary()` counts `.wav` and `.ogg` (the blooper) as sounds.
- `game_files()` still matches `GAME_FILES` in the top folder. `*.wav` stays in it so an untouched flat original bundle (`--game`) still builds.
- `data_summary()` words the counts for both `copy_game()` and `--dry-run`. With the repo's `game/` since the dev's second sound sort (2026-09-24), and `unused/` in builds, that is 507 files: 362 sounds (236 used, 126 unused), plus 145 plists and map layers. It was 474, with 329 sounds, before the sort.

## Still to do
1. **Bring `--test` back once the game supports it.** `SixthSenseReborn.py` needs a log file in `%APPDATA%\SixthSense`, a `crash.txt` excepthook, an `--exit-after N` flag and a "game data: <path>" log line. Then restore `test_build()` and `read_log()` from the reference script in `user/`, adapted without its HRTF check. This also fixes the evaluation's "no crash path" item; see SixthSenseOriginal's `project_evaluation_2026_09` note.
2. **Silent failures:** until item 1 lands, a `--windowed` build that fails to start is silent. Tell the dev to use the console build (menu choice 4, `--console`) to diagnose.

## Test builds versus release builds
Since 2026-09-23 no compiler build changes the repository, so any choice is safe for a trial build. For a trial, point the dev at:
- choice 7, `--dry-run`, first
- choice 4, `--console`, which shows start-up errors
- choice 2, the single exe, to try what a release carries

A release is made only with `releaser.py`, which runs the compiler itself after setting the version ([[release_tooling_plan]]).

## Fine as-is
- `BINARIES`: the vendor DLLs go to `_MEIPASS/vendor/...`, which is where `sixthsense/paths.py` looks when frozen.
- `SIDE_FILES`: `docks\readme.txt` (the player readme, [[player_readme_plan]]), `docks\changelog.txt` and `docks\todo list.txt` (the player documents folder since 2026-09-23, named by `DOCKS` and `CHANGELOG`), VERSION and LICENSE (shipped as license.txt). Since 2026-09-24 (the dev found it a bug that they sat at the top) the three documents land in a `docks\` folder in the build, as in the repository; VERSION and license.txt stay at the top, the license beside `licenses\`. `strip_shipped_changelog()` and the release warnings read `docks\changelog.txt` in the build. Never embedded. `releaser.py` reads the same `compiler.CHANGELOG`, and commits it as `CHANGELOG_GIT` (`docks/changelog.txt`).
- `.gitignore` covers `build/`, `dist/` and `*.spec`.
- **The third-party licenses go inside the executable since 2026-09-25** (the dev: "I want the license files to be embedded into the exe. The MIT licence file can stay."). `stage_licenses()` gathers `license_files()` fresh into `build\embed\licenses` (`LICENSES_STAGE`) before PyInstaller runs, and `command()` adds that folder as `licenses` for every kind of build, so a one-file or `--embed` build carries it inside the exe and a folder build in `_internal\licenses`. `copy_licenses()` and the `licenses\` folder beside the exe are gone; `license.txt`, the port's own MIT license, stays beside it in `SIDE_FILES`. The player readme says the licenses are inside the game.
- **The build folder is `dist\SixthSense-Windows` since 2026-09-25** (the dev: "it should create the folder SixthSense-Windows, not, SixthSense"). `FOLDER = NAME + '-Windows'`; `NAME` stays `SixthSense`, so the executable is still `SixthSense.exe` and the release is still "SixthSense V<version>" in `SixthSense-Win-<version>.zip`. `output_dir()` is the new folder, and the releaser's `BUILD_DIR` is `compiler.output_dir()`. A one-file or `--embed` build goes there directly through `--distpath`; a folder build's PyInstaller always names its folder after `--name`, so it lands in `dist\SixthSense` (`pyinstaller_dir()`) and `move_folder_build()` moves it. `clear_output()` empties both before a build. The releaser's zip puts everything under `SixthSense-Windows/`, so it extracts to that folder too. The older builds and notes below say `dist/SixthSense`.

## Environment on 2026-09-21
- The dev installed **PyInstaller 6.22.3** into their Python 3.12 x64 (`C:\Users\tonys\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312`).
- comtypes, numpy and av are not installed. Since 2026-09-22 the build needs prismatoid, and 0.18.2 is installed with cffi 2.1.1.
- PyInstaller 6 puts onedir builds' bundled files under `dist/SixthSense/_internal`, which is `sys._MEIPASS`.
- The game data goes beside the exe, in `dist/SixthSense/game`, which is `EXE_DIR/game`.

**How to apply:** Keep `compiler.py`'s structure and prose style (the menu, the flags, the spoken messages). Compare against the reference script in `user/` when bringing features across.

**Changed 2026-09-28:** it also builds on Linux (the dev builds in WSL), into `dist/SixthSense-Linux`, from a table by system, `SYSTEMS` ([[linux_build_plan]]).
