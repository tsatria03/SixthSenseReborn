**Never build anything unless the dev says to.** That covers `compiler.py`, PyInstaller, and any packaging or zip step.

**Only the tests that match what changed (2026-09-23).** When one or more Python files change and a test script covers them, run only that script or those scripts, not the whole suite. For example, a change to `game/store.py` runs `tests/case/store.py`. Run the full suite only when the dev asks, for example once they have more than five commits that are not pushed, or after the conversation has been compacted. The dev said: "Do not keep running the full test suite over and over again." This replaces the earlier pause of 2026-09-22 ("for the next few commits, do not run tests unless I say so").

**During a batch of fixes, run no tests between the commits** (the dev, 2026-09-24: "Please don't run tests between each commit. Wait untill all of the commits are done before doing the full test suite, and if I give you the go ahead"). Make the batch's commits, then run the full suite once at the end, and only when the dev gives the go-ahead.

**The test suite may be run without asking.** The dev gave this standing permission on 2026-09-22 ("From now on, you are allowed to run test suites"). It covers the files in `tests/`, run one by one as plain scripts. Always run them the safe way ([[project_safe_test_run]]). Since 2026-09-24 the tests keep off the dev's save and are silent by themselves (no speech, no sound, no window), wherever they are run from; the dev's rule is that testing speaks nothing whatsoever. Before that, `APPDATA` had to point at a scratch folder and the null audio driver had to be set by hand.

**Still ask first before running:**
- the game (`python SixthSense.py`, including `--no-window` runs)
- `compiler.py` in any mode, including `--dry-run`
- scratch scripts that import and execute game code to check behaviour
- anything that could speak through NVDA or Prism for real, or play sound

Make the edits, report them, and hand verification by ear back to the dev.

**Read-only inspection is always fine:** reading and grepping files; `git status`, `git diff` and `git log`; listing installed packages; reading package metadata; and parsing the binary's bytes for analysis. When unsure which side of the line something falls on, ask.

**Why:** The dev set the original rule on 2026-09-21. They run and verify builds themselves, and they work with NVDA running, so an unexpected run can make noise, touch their save, or leave stray processes and artifacts. Tests run the safe way do none of that, which is why they were freed up on 2026-09-22.

**How to apply:** After a code change, run only the test scripts that cover the changed files, the safe way, and report the result. Leave the full suite for when the dev asks. When a change needs checking by ear, end with a clear "relaunch to test" note instead of running the game.
