description: "Whenever a change players will notice lands (a bug fix or an enhancement), add a plain sentence at the top of the unrelease: block in changelog.txt, in the same commit; entries read newest first. LF, no BOM, one sentence per line, no markdown; release builds file the section under the version."

**Keep `changelog.txt` up to date as game changes land.** Every commit that fixes a bug or adds an enhancement a player will notice also adds a line under `unrelease:` at the top of `changelog.txt`. Since 2026-09-23 it lives in `docks/`, the player documents folder, with the todo list; the compiler ships it from there and the releaser files and commits it there.

**Why:** On 2026-09-22 the dev pointed out that the changelog should have been updated with each bug fix and enhancement. It had been missed since the initial import, and the eleven changes from 2026-09-21 were then added in one go.

Releases are made with `releaser.py` ([[release_tooling_plan]]). Before the first, on 2026-09-22, the dev had removed a `26.09.20: Initial release.` entry because no release had happened then. The releaser files `unrelease:` under each new version; the compiler never does.

**How to apply:**
- **Format.** This is what `compiler.py`'s `_parse_changelog` reads:
  - A heading is one word ending in a colon, on a line of its own: `unrelease:` or a version like `26.09.21-1:`.
  - Every other line is an entry: one plain sentence or two, with no bullets, numbers or markdown.
  - A blank line separates one heading's block from the next.
- **LF, no BOM.** Checked 2026-09-22: both the working tree and HEAD use LF, whatever older notes said. Match the endings the file has when you edit it, and check afterwards.
- **A line that is reworded goes back to the top too** (the dev, 2026-10-07: "make sure to add them in reverse cronilogical order. As in newest thing changed and or added"). The order is when a line last changed, not when it was first written: on 2026-10-07 the reload line was reworded in place, below the newer tutorial line, and the dev moved it up by hand.
- **New lines go at the top of the `unrelease:` block**, straight under the heading, so the block reads newest first. The dev asked for this on 2026-09-22 and the 23 lines that had built up in landing order were reversed then. If there is no `unrelease:` heading, add it at the very top, followed by a blank line before the newest version.
- **Only what a player notices:** fixes, enhancements, removed features, new sounds or files they will see. Debug mode (`--debug`) is developer-facing and never goes here.
  - Leave out notes, docs, tests, refactors and build-script internals, unless they change what ships.
  - Bugs that are only found or planned stay in `todo list.txt`, not here.
- **Wording.** Write for a player, in the style of the todo list's finished section: say what is now true, and avoid contractions.
- **Headings stay as they are** (the dev's choice, 2026-09-22):
  - bare, date-based version numbers like `26.09.21-1:`, which mean year, month, day and that day's build
  - `unrelease:` for changes that are not released yet

  A format like "Version 26.09.21-1:" or "Unreleased:" was offered, which would need `_HEADING`, `UNRELEASE` and `changelog_heading()` in `compiler.py` changed. The dev declined. Don't propose it again unless asked.
- **How big a release is (the dev, 2026-09-23).** A release aims for 50 to 100 changelog entries, fixes and enhancements alike, depending on how much the game still needs. It does not have to reach 100, and it can go out with fewer than 50 when there are not that many to make. **100 is a hard ceiling: never more than 100.** **And 5 is a hard floor (the dev, 2026-09-24): a version with fewer than 5 entries does not qualify for a release.** `releaser.py` enforces both (`MIN_ENTRIES`, `MAX_ENTRIES`): its check and its prepare step refuse more than 100, and none at all. **With 1 to 4, the dev asked the same day for a force override:** the releaser says how many there are and asks "Release anyway with N change(s)?" (`release_anyway`); Y goes on, anything else refuses as before. The check asks only when nothing else is in the way, and a full release asks once, in the check (`step_prepare(forced=True)` after it). The dev decides when a release is ready, and each release starts `unrelease:` again at 0. Individual releases are not recorded here ([[feedback_no_release_records]]); GitHub's releases page and the changelog's own headings are the record. **How to count (the dev, 2026-09-25):** a heading is never an entry. `unrelease:` and a version heading such as `26.09.24-2:` are not counted; only the lines under the heading are, up to the blank line. Count them from the file each time (read the block and number its lines), never from a running tally: on 2026-09-25 Claude reported 11 when there were 10, after one slip carried into every count after it. Count the entries under `unrelease:` whenever one is added, and say so when the block nears 100, so the dev can release before it would pass the ceiling, and say so when it is still under 5. Never file the block under a version or run a build yourself ([[feedback_dont_run_or_build]]).
- **Released entries stay as they are.** `releaser.py` moves the `unrelease:` lines under the new version's heading, for example `26.09.23-1:`. Never edit an entry that already has a version heading.
- **No credit lines.** Entries say what changed, not who changed it. On 2026-09-22 the dev chose no credit for tunmi13productions' coin and spoken-number fixes ("no credit"). Don't add contributor credits to the changelog unless the dev asks; commit trailers and [[project_provenance]] carry the credit instead.
