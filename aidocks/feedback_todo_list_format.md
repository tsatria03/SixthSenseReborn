`todo list.txt` in `docks/` (the player documents folder, since 2026-09-23; it was at the repo root before), with a space in the name, is the dev's task list.

**Players only (2026-09-23).** It holds only bugs and enhancements a player notices, the same bar as `changelog.txt` ([[feedback_changelog]]), because it ships beside the game in every release. Work on the repository, the tools, the tests, the build and the docs, and anything about debug mode (`--debug`), goes in [[project_dev_tasks]] instead. When a line mixes the two, split it: the part a player notices stays, worded for a player, and the rest moves.

Its format:
- `##Unfinished.` on the first line, a blank line, then one item per line.
- A blank line, then `##Finished.`, a blank line, and its items below.
- **Every heading is followed by one blank line, and a new item goes after that blank line**, at the top of the items (the dev, 2026-09-24: "When you add a finished entry, put it after the blank line"). Never put an item straight under the heading: on 2026-09-24 Claude did, above the blank line, which split the finished section. With the Edit tool, match the heading and the blank line together (`##Finished.\n\n`) and insert after both. The dev capitalized both headings on 2026-09-21; keep them that way.
- Each item is a plain sentence or two. **A bug is stated as what happens, with no "Fix a bug where" in front**: "Switching weapons refills the magazine for free.", not "Fix a bug where switching weapons refills the magazine for free." The dev found that opening too repetitive (2026-09-21).
- An enhancement or task starts with what to do: "Add ...", "Make ...", "Remove ...", "Update ...", "Decide whether ...", "Test ...".
- A `##finished.` item says what is now true, starting with its subject: "The license credits tsatria03 and lbk2907.", "The compiler has been changed to build Sixth Sense." List real milestones, not housekeeping like rewording this file, with the most significant first. The first six were added on 2026-09-21 at the dev's request.
- No numbering, no bullets, no markdown, no file:line references. Write in plain words about what the player or dev experiences.
- Avoid contractions, as the existing lines do ("does not", not "doesn't").
- **New items go at the top of `##unfinished.`**, most important first, above the existing ones.
- **In `##Finished.`, newest change first, and a reworded line goes back to the top** (the dev, 2026-10-07: "make sure to add them in reverse cronilogical order. As in newest thing changed and or added"), as in the changelog ([[feedback_changelog]]).
- The file uses **LF** line endings with no BOM (checked 2026-09-22; older notes said CRLF). Match what the file has when you edit it. Keep every line well under 1024 characters.

**Why:** The dev asked on 2026-09-21 for new items to go at the top and for the file's existing style to be matched. They read it by screen reader, so plain sentences read cleanly and markdown symbols would be spoken aloud.

**How to apply:**
- **A player-facing finding that is reported to the dev, and not fixed in the same change, goes into `##Unfinished.` as soon as it is reported.** The Bitbee logo sound was found by a binary recheck on 2026-09-23, reported and fixed later; the dev said "This should of been added to the todo list." So a finding waiting on the dev's decision is a todo line at once, and moves to finished when it is done and confirmed.
- **A bug found and fixed in the same change goes straight into `##Finished.`**, worded as what is now true. Never add it to unfinished first. The dev asked "why are you putting it in the unfinished section when you plan to fix it?" on 2026-09-22. The confirm-first rule is for items that were already in unfinished.
- **Keep each item as short as the others, one or two short sentences.** On 2026-09-22 the dev called a five-sentence finished item "way too long" and had it cut to two. Say what is now true; leave the how (examples, wording, reasons) to the changelog or memory.
- After editing, check the line endings with a byte check (the Edit tool can insert LF-only lines).
- Move an item to `##finished.` only when the dev confirms it is done, not when code lands, since the dev runs and verifies; see [[feedback_dont_run_or_build]].
- The technical detail behind each item (file:line, root cause) lives in a plan or memory note, not in the todo file.
