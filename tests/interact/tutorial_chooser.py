"""PORT ADDITION, for testing by ear: start the tutorial at any lesson, with either of its
endings, and voice over on or off.  Not a test, and not part of the game: the tests are in
``tests\\case``, and this is one of the tools in ``tests\\interact`` that you play.

    python tests\\interact\\tutorial_chooser.py --lesson 9                  the animal zombie
    python tests\\interact\\tutorial_chooser.py --ending start --lesson 10  P, then 3, 2, 1 into the game
    python tests\\interact\\tutorial_chooser.py --voice off                 with the key hints
    python tests\\interact\\tutorial_chooser.py                             asks for all three

The two endings, from the binary (see ``stage_tutorial.py``):

    start   the tutorial a first Start runs: once it is over, P counts 3, 2, 1 and
            starts the real game with "zombies are coming"
    menu    the tutorial the Tutorial button runs: P goes back to the main menu

The ten lessons, in the order the tutorial teaches them:

     1  shooting at 9 o'clock         6  the stronger zombie
     2  shooting at 10:30             7  reloading
     3  shooting at 12 o'clock        8  changing weapon
     4  shooting at 1:30              9  shaking off the animal zombie
     5  shooting at 3 o'clock        10  ending the tutorial with P

Starting at a lesson counts every lesson before it as done, so the tutorial goes on from
there exactly as it would have, and lesson One is never heard.

Voice over is the main menu's voice over row.  The recorded instructions play either way;
with it off, the screen reader also names the keys to press for each one.

**Your save is never touched.**  It plays on its own save in
``%APPDATA%\\SixthSense\\tutorial_chooser``, and takes a fresh copy of your key bindings
each time it starts.  Choosing Tutorial from its main menu starts the chosen lesson again.
