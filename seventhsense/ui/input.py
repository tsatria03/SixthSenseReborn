"""Keyboard in place of the iPhone's touchscreen and accelerometer.

The original has four inputs, all of them on the device:

    UIPanGestureRecognizer          -> -[Stage_1_E MovingShot:]          attack, by angle
    UITapGestureRecognizer, 2 touch -> -[Stage_1_E doubleTapChangeWeapon:]
    UITapGestureRecognizer, 3 touch -> -[Stage_1_E threeTapChangeWeapon:]
    UIAccelerometer                 -> -[Stage_1_E accelerometer:didAccelerate:]
                                       (shaking free of a zombie that has grabbed you)

``MovingAccelerometer`` would turn you on a tilt, but nothing in the binary creates one
or sends ``setListenerRotation:``, so the original never turns you, and neither does
the port.

Windows gets the same inputs on the keyboard, through ``platform/keymap.py``, which holds
the bindings and resolves chords. The defaults put the five lanes on the arrow keys in
the shape the tutorial describes - it teaches them as clock positions, and the arrows
are a clock face:

        9 o'clock   Left        10:30  Left+Up      12  Up
        1:30  Right+Up          3      Right        6   Down = reload

with A Q W E D S bound alongside for a one-handed grip. F1 opens the binding screen; F1 and Escape are the two
keys that cannot be rebound.

Escape pauses a stage, as P does, and on the pause panel it resumes, as Continue does.
In the tutorial, where the stop button skips the lessons, Escape still leaves for the
menu.

The lane keys replace the swipe rather than simulating it, which loses nothing:
``-[Stage_1_E MovingShot:]`` quantises its angle into five bands and a reload sector
before anything else looks at it, so a key hands the stage the band directly.

There is no mouse. Everything is reachable without leaving the home row or the arrow
cluster, which is the point for a game meant to be played with the screen off.
