"""Filesystem locations used by the port.

``game/`` holds the original app bundle's data, the contents of ``Payload/sixsense.app``
as it shipped - the binary plists (``SoundList.plist``, the ``typeN.plist`` monster
tables, the weapon tables), the three map layers (``g_CH1_E``, ``s_CH1_E.txt``,
``a_CH1_E.txt``), the nibs, the PNGs, ``Info.plist``, the Facebook resource bundle and
the code signature - all in its top folder, where the original kept them.

The sounds are the one exception.  The original bundle is flat, with its 269 WAVs beside
the plists; the port keeps them in folders under ``game/sounds/used``, each under its
original file name.  So ``path_for_resource``, which stands in for
``[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:ofType:]``, looks in the top folder first, as the
original did, then by file name anywhere under ``sounds/used``, which holds what the game
plays, and last under ``sounds/unused``, which holds what it never plays: the sounds of
the rows and zombies the port leaves out, extra copies, and files that are not the
original's own.  A name in ``sounds/used`` always wins, and no name the sound list uses
belongs to one of the files that are not the original's own.

Because the top folder comes first, an untouched original bundle still works: its WAVs are
all found where the original found them.

The port never writes to ``game/``.  The save file lives in ``%APPDATA%\\SeventhSense`` on
Windows, ``~/.local/share/SeventhSense`` on Linux, ``~/Library/Application Support/SeventhSense``
on macOS, or wherever ``SEVENTHSENSE_USER_DIR`` points,
which the tests use.

``--game PATH`` (or ``SEVENTHSENSE_GAME``) points somewhere else: another copy of the
bundle, or a folder holding ``Payload/sixsense.app``.
