"""PORT ADDITION: the volume knobs, in decibels.

Every gain in this game comes out of the binary, and each one is written where it is used
with the address it was read from: the level music at 0.02 (0x321d4), the ambience at 0.2
(0x2ddfa), the rain at 0.5 (0x2ddc8), a gunshot at 1.0.  Those numbers stay exactly as they
are, so the mix is still the original's.

What is here instead is a set of knobs that move whole groups of sounds, in decibels,
because decibels are how loudness is actually talked about: +6 dB is twice the amplitude,
-6 dB is half, and about 10 dB either way is heard as twice or half as loud.  At 0.0 a knob
changes nothing at all, so the mix as shipped is the binary's until someone turns one.

    MASTER_DB       everything the game plays
    MUSIC_DB        the level music, under the zombies
    AMBIENCE_DB     the cave, the forest and the rain
    MENU_MUSIC_DB   the menu music, which is the port's own sound and so has no gain in
                    the binary to start from - this one is the whole value, not a trim

``MASTER_DB`` is applied in ``oal_playback``, where every ``AL_GAIN`` is set, so it reaches
sound effects, speech recordings and music alike.  The group knobs are applied where the
sound is started, because only the caller knows what kind of sound it is starting.

The decibel knobs are constants.  On top of them sit the player's settings (tsatria03,
2026-09-25; aidocks/completed/volume_settings_plan.md), percentages kept in settings.json and
changed only by editing it:

    MASTERVOLUME       everything, with MASTER_DB
    MENUMUSICVOLUME    the menu music, which Page Up and Page Down also set
    LEVELMUSICVOLUME   the level music, with MUSIC_DB
    AMBIENCEVOLUME     the ambience and the rain, with AMBIENCE_DB

Each is a whole number from 0 to 100; 100, the default, is the original's mix, and anything
else counts as 100.  The percentage is squared into the gain (``percent_gain``), so each
step sounds about as big as the last.  ``load`` reads them when the game starts and writes
any that are missing, so settings.json shows every one; an edit takes effect on the next
start.

During play there are three more (tunmi13productions, 2026-09-26;
aidocks/completed/gameplay_gain_plan.md), which Page Up and Page Down with a modifier set
in the stage, the tutorial and the test range, as well as by hand:

    GAMEPLAYGAIN       0 to 6 dB on OpenAL's listener, so every sound effect and the
                       recorded speech louder together, the balance between them kept;
                       the music and the ambience are held where they were
    WEAPONVOLUME       the weapons, sfx/weapons, but not their hits
    PLAYERVOLUME       your breathing, being hurt and dying

The entities (the zombies, the bosses, the monster and the woman, and a weapon's hit on
one) had a setting too, ENTITYVOLUME, until tunmi13productions removed it on 2026-09-28:
they are what the player listens for, so they always play at full volume
(aidocks/completed/entity_full_volume_plan.md).

The two groups are percentages like the rest and only turn down, since the settings'
part of a source's gain is capped at 1.0 (``oal_playback._gain``) and a gunshot is there
already; the gain is the way up.  ``group_of`` sorts
a sound into its group as its buffer loads, and ``oal_playback`` applies it.
