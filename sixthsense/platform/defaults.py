"""``NSUserDefaults`` - JSON files in ``%APPDATA%\\SixthSenseReborn``.

The keys are the ones the binary writes, with the classes that own them:

    TUTORIAL        int    ``-[Stage_1_E viewDidLoad]``     0 until the tutorial is finished
    GOLD            int    ``AppDelegate.haveGold``
    (FIREST, COIN, COIN_TIMER and COIN_TIMER_START belonged to the coins, which are gone:
    games are free.  An old save may still hold them; nothing reads them.)
    GRENADECOUNT    int    ``-[Stage_1_E MovingShot:]``     grenades in hand
    STAGE           int    ``-[MainController ...]``        highest stage unlocked
    SHOTGUN, M4, AK47, MG80, JAPAN
                    int    owned weapons, ``-[AppDelegate weaponHave]``
    GRENADEUSE, KNIFEUSE, COLTUSE, SHOTGUNUSE, M4USE, AK47USE, MG80USE, JAPANUSE
                    int    equipped weapons
    (EYEMODE, the voice-over row, is gone: the game is always read by the screen reader.)
    TOPSCORE, TOPSCOREWEEK, WEEKTIME, NOWRANK, REVIEWCOUNT
                           the result panel's records, ``-[Stage_1_E SuccessOrFailMission]``

and the port's own: ``MENUMUSICVOLUME`` (the menu music's volume), and each weapon's
spoken stats, ``<W>AMMOCAPACITY``, ``<W>RANGE``, ``<W>DAMAGE`` and ``<W>PRICE``, written and
never read (``game/weapon_stats.py``).

``synchronize`` writes the files; the original's does the same thing.

PORT ADDITION (tsatria03, 2026-09-25): the original keeps everything in one plist.  The
port keeps it in two files, routed by key name, beside ``keys.json`` (``keymap.py``):

    save.json       progress: every key not named in SETTINGS_KEYS, which is the safe
                    place for a key added later
    settings.json   the player's preferences, SETTINGS_KEYS, written in that order

Nothing that uses ``UserDefaults`` has to know which file a key lives in.  A
``defaults.json`` from before the split is moved over by itself the first time the game
starts without a ``save.json``, and kept as ``defaults.json.old``
(aidocks/completed/save_split_plan.md).

PORT ADDITION: a file that cannot be read is never written over.  It is kept as
``<file>.damaged``, and the game carries on from ``<file>.bak``, the copy before the last
write, which every ``synchronize`` keeps.
