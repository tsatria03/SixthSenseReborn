"""PORT ADDITION: the game's voice.

The original spoke entirely through its recorded WAVs, which ``SoundList.plist`` names by
number.  The port first used this module only for the words those recordings could not
say, such as the key-binding screen's key names; since 2026-10-05 it says everything
(aidocks/completed/screen_reader_only_plan.md).

Every line goes to the player's screen reader, or to a plain voice when none is running.
Before every line, the first of these that can speak says it:

    NVDA         through its own controller client, vendor/nvda/nvdaControllerClient64.dll
    the others   through Prism (the prismatoid package): JAWS, ZDSR, ZoomText, System
                 Access, PC-Talker, Boy PC Reader, Sense Reader, Window-Eyes, and Narrator
    a voice      SAPI 5 through Prism, or Windows' OneCore voices if SAPI will not start,
                 for a player with no screen reader running at all
    Linux/macOS  Orca or Speech Dispatcher; VoiceOver or AVSpeech, through Prism
    nothing      if none of them can speak; the game still works, it just says nothing

NVDA keeps a client of its own because asking it "are you running?" before every line is
cheap and certain, and a player with NVDA never loads Prism at all. Prism is optional: if it
is not installed, or its library will not load, the log says so and NVDA carries on alone.

Everything the game says goes through here since 2026-10-05; it plays no recorded voice.
