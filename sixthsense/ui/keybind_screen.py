"""PORT ADDITION: the key-binding screen, opened with F1 and read aloud.

The game is self-voicing from recorded WAVs, and none of them can say "Left Arrow" or
"Attack 10:30" - so this one screen speaks through ``platform/speech.py``: NVDA or another
screen reader when one is running, a Windows voice otherwise. Everything it says, it says
on entry and on every move,
because there is nothing on screen a player of this game is expected to read.

    Up / Down       move through the actions
    Enter           bind: hold the key or chord you want, then let go
    A               add a second binding instead of replacing
    Delete          unbind
    R               reset everything to the defaults - twice, since it asks first
    F1 / Escape     back to the game

Binding captures a *chord*: hold Left and Up together and release, and the action gets
``Left + Up``. The keys are recorded when the first one of them comes back up, so the
order you press them in does not matter. Letting go of the Enter that started the capture
does not count, or the capture would be over before the player had pressed anything.

F1 and Escape are never rebindable (``keymap.FIXED``) - bind over the way out and there
would be no way back in.
