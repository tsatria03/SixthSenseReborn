Gold is local - ``NSUserDefaults`` key ``GOLD``, which ``Stage_1_E`` pays into at the
end of a run - so buying a weapon works here exactly as it did on the phone.  The two
things that do not are the gold store and the coin store, which were in-app purchases,
*Purchase all weapons*, which was the StoreKit product ``SixthSense.AllWeapon``, and
restore purchases.  The game leaves all four rows out: Apple's
in-app purchases no longer exist, and there are no recordings for buying any of them with
gold instead.

The weapon table below is not data: ``-[DetailStoreController viewDidLoad]`` sets it
out weaponType by weaponType in code (0x192f2..0x1a0ec), and the numbers here are the
literals from those branches.
