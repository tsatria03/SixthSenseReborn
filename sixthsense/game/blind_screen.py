"""The shape every blind-mode screen in this game shares.

``MainController``, ``Stage_1_E``'s result panel, the shop, the weapon pages and the
inventory are all built the same way (see ``aidocks/GAME_STRUCTURE.md`` §8):

    -[X selectTapPointSoundStart]   maps the finger's Y to one of N bands, stores the
                                    band in ``selectMenu``, plays that row's WAV and
                                    sometimes schedules a number to be read behind it
    -[X tapCount]                   a ``tbb`` table on ``selectMenu - 1``: what a
                                    double tap on the row does
    -[X StopElseSpeak]              stop every WAV this screen can say, and cancel any
                                    reader still queued

Each band guards on its own flag (``go_back_flag``, ``weapon_flag``, ...) so that a
finger resting on a row does not say it twice.  A keyboard moves between rows one event
at a time, so the move is the guard, and Up/Down/Enter stand in for drag-and-double-tap
exactly as they do in ``MainController``.

Nothing about the rows, their order, their sounds or what they do is invented here;
every subclass carries the addresses it was read from.
