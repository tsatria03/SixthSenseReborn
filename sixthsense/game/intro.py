"""The opening screen: the splash, the warning and the story.

    -[startIntroPage ...]   0x16f68..0x18b20

Before it, ``-[AppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:]`` puts up the
publisher's logo and plays its sound, *bitbee_1* (340), and 3.5 s later
``realStartIntro`` makes this the root view controller (0x4af0).  The port has no launch
of its own to put the logo in, so this screen plays it first (``viewDidLoad``).  Then it
shows ``0_splash2.png`` for two seconds (0x1745c stores 0x4000000000000000 as the delay),
then reads the player's saved settings and plays *Welcome to* - the warning about
headphones, noisy rooms and who should not play.  A double tap anywhere skips to the
menu.

``intro2storyPage`` (0x2b288..0x2c4d0) is the same screen with the story on it, and
**nothing in the binary ever creates one** - the story lives here, in ``shakeDevice``.
