"""``Stage_1_E`` - the stage itself.  Ported from 0x2c4d0..0x3f4d1.

How the game actually works, established from the binary:

**The world.**  A 701 x 42 grid (``MakeMaps``), of which only column 20 is walkable: the
player starts at ``(20, 680)`` (0x2cf04, 0x2cf1a) and walks *down* in Y.  One cell is
40 cm (``-[Stage_1_E soundFunction:...]`` multiplies squared cell distance by 1600).

**The clock.**  ``MotionSamplingTimer`` fires ``MainControl`` once a second
(0x2e092: ``vmov.f64 d16, #1.0``).  Each tick is one step forward, one breath, one
spawn check, one round of monster attacks.

**Monsters do not live on the grid.**  A monster has a *lane* and a *range*.  Five lanes,
by compass bearing, from ``MovingType`` in its plist:

        MovingType  1  WZ    180 deg     west, hard left
                    2  WNZ   123 deg
                    3  NZ     90 deg     straight ahead
                    4  ENZ    57 deg
                    5  EZ      0 deg     east, hard right

Only one monster per lane at a time (``checkMonsterArray:`` 0x36458 rejects a type whose
``id % 10`` lane is taken).  Each footstep closes the range by ``comingRange`` cm and
makes the sound 1.1x louder.  At 25 cm it is on top of you.

**Fighting.**  A swipe (``MovingShot:`` 0x2ec98) is ``atan2`` of the accumulated pan,
in degrees, quantised into the same five lanes; the result is ``shotMonster`` 1..5.
``monsterHitHeadFind`` (0x3ab88) then takes the nearest monster whose ``MovingPosAngle``
falls in that lane's band and is inside the weapon's ``Range``:

        shotMonster 1   157..202 deg        4    23..62
                    2   113..155            5     0..22 or 338..360
                    3    63..112

A hit lands for ``weapon.Damage``; a hit taken while the monster's ``headShotFlag`` is up -
the pause in its breathing - lands for ``Damage * 2`` and counts as a headshot
(0x3a1dc: ``HP - (damage << 1)``).

**Progress.**  At Y == 29 an alarm sounds; at Y == 23 the level's boss comes down the
middle lane and the alarm stops.  The player walks one more cell and waits at 22 until
``checkBoosDie`` says the boss is dead.  Then every zombie left is killed, the ambience
changes, and ``ChangeLevel:`` (0x322e0) puts the player back at 680 with
``monsterHPGain`` 1.5 times higher, now in the other environment, cave or forest.
The action layer of the map (``a_CH1_E.txt``) sets the spawn tier along the way: values
1..7 set ``monster_num``, 8 sends the girl or the woman zombie, 9 stops the music and
starts a quiet stretch, and 10 starts the music.  A melee hit is only ever plain damage.
