"""PORT ADDITION: the debug commands, live only with ``--debug``.

The original has nothing like them.  In debug mode nothing takes a heart and nothing you
kill counts (``Stage_1_E``, ``AppDelegate.debug``); these keys are for trying the game
out by ear.  They are keymap actions, so the F1 screen lists and rebinds them:

    F2          the start of the next section of the corridor, in the same level
    Shift+F2    next level, the way the end of a level goes; after level 8, level 1
    F3          zombies keep level 1's health, or grow with the level again
    F4          zombies keep level 1's speed, or grow with the level again; both F3 and F4
                change the zombies already walking too (tsatria03, 2026-10-07)
    F5          spawn the chosen zombie, in the lane you last attacked
    Shift+F5    choose what F5 spawns
    F6          hold every zombie where it is, or let them walk again
    F7          let zombies that reach you hit you, still for no heart, or die again
    F8          turn the sound trims off or on (platform/sound_trims.py), to hear them
                against the files as they are; this one works in the tutorial too
    F11         say where each zombie is

Debug mode also hands you every weapon on Tab and Shift+Tab, bought or not, and no
shot, no grenade and no magazine ever runs out (``Stage_1_E``).

Everything here speaks through the screen reader:
the game has no recordings for any of it.  They do nothing in the tutorial, which
runs on its own script, and F2 and Shift+F2 do nothing in the weapon test range,
where you never walk.
